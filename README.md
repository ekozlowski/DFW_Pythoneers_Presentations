DFW_Pythoneers_Presentations
============================

This is a space for me to host presentation material from any presentations I've given at the DFW Pythoneers meetings.

Log_Data_Processor.ipynb
------------------------

This is an IPython Notebook that I demoed during a brief presentation on 2/8/2014 at the Saturday Teaching Meeting of DFW Pythoneers.  It demos a basic use-case for the IPython notebook.

We needed to figure out what was causing processing delays in our backend, and I came up with the quick notebook in order to present the information while being able to re-parse the info quickly and graphically.  IPython notebook was great for this, because I was able to edit the python code and re-run the information while my team was watching.

Log_Data_Processor.py

This is just the python export of the Log_Data_Processor.ipynb IPython Notebook file.
